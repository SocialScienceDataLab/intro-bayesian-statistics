## Abstract
Besides the frequentist approach to statistical inference, which
was dominant in science in the 20th century, another school exists:
Bayesian Statistics. With modern computational techniques, Bayesian
data analysis has a proven track-record and established itself as
an alternative to frequentist procedures. Sometimes, Bayesian
techniques can be applied to complex scientific questions where no
frequentist solution exists.

This talk gives an introduction to Bayesian statistics. While it is
not possible to avoid central mathematical formulas and
derivations, I concentrate on concepts, intuitive motivations, and
interpretations that underlie the Bayesian view. Critical model
assumptions are also discussed. Participants will learn when to
mistrust a Bayesian analysis and in which situations it may provide
new insights.
